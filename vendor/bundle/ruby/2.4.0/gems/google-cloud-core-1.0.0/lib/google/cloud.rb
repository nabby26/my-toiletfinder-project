# # Google Cloud
#
# The google-cloud library is the official library for interacting with Google
# Cloud Platform. Google Cloud Platform is a set of modular cloud-based services
# that allow you to create anything from simple websites to complex
# applications.
#
# The goal of google-cloud is to provide a API that is familiar and comfortable
# to Rubyists. Authentication is handled by providing project and credential
# information, or if you are running on Google Compute Engine this configuration
# is taken care of for you.
#
# You can learn more about various options for connection on the [Authentication
# Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/guides/authentication).
