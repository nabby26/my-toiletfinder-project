# google-cloud-debugger

[Stackdriver Debugger](https://cloud.google.com/debugger/) ([docs](https://cloud.google.com/debugger/docs/)) lets you inspect the state of a running application at any code location in real time, without stopping or slowing down the application, and without modifying the code to add logging statements. You can use Stackdriver Debugger with any deployment of your application, including test, development, and production. The Ruby debugger adds minimal request latency, typically less than 50ms, and only when the application state is captured. In most cases, this is not noticeable by users.

## Quick Start

Setting up Stackdriver Debugger involves three steps:

1. Add the `google-cloud-debugger` library to your app.
2. Register your app's source code.
3. Deploy your app and set a breakpoint.

See the
[google-cloud-debugger documentation](http://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-debugger/master/google/cloud/debugger)
for a quick tutorial.

## Authentication

This library uses Service Account credentials to connect to Google Cloud services. When running on Compute Engine the credentials will be discovered automatically. When running on other environments the Service Account credentials can be specified by providing the path to the JSON file, or the JSON itself, in environment variables.

Instructions and configuration options are covered in the [Authentication Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-debugger/guides/authentication).

## Usage

This library provides a Stackdriver Debugger Agent that's able to work with Ruby applications. It also integrates with Ruby on Rails and other popular Rack-based frameworks. See the [Instrumentation Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-debugger/guides/instrumentation) for more details.
