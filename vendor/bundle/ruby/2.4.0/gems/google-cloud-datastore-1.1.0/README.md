# google-cloud-datastore

[Google Cloud Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/) ([docs](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs)) is a fully managed, schemaless database for storing non-relational data. Cloud Datastore automatically scales with your users and supports ACID transactions, high availability of reads and writes, strong consistency for reads and ancestor queries, and eventual consistency for all other queries.

Follow the [activation instructions](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/activate) to use the Google Cloud Datastore API with your project.

## Quick Start

```sh
$ gem install google-cloud-datastore
```

## Authentication

This library uses Service Account credentials to connect to Google Cloud services. When running on Compute Engine the credentials will be discovered automatically. When running on other environments the Service Account credentials can be specified by providing the path to the JSON file, or the JSON itself, in environment variables.

Instructions and configuration options are covered in the [Authentication Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-datastore/guides/authentication).

## Example

```ruby
require "google/cloud/datastore"

datastore = Google::Cloud::Datastore.new(
  project: "my-todo-project",
  keyfile: "/path/to/keyfile.json"
)

# Create a new task to demo datastore
task = datastore.entity "Task", "sampleTask" do |t|
  t["type"] = "Personal"
  t["done"] = false
  t["priority"] = 4
  t["description"] = "Learn Cloud Datastore"
end

# Save the new task
datastore.save task

# Run a query for all completed tasks
query = datastore.query("Task").
  where("done", "=", false)
tasks = datastore.run query
```
