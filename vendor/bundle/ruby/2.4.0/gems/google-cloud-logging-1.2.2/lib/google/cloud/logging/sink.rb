      # # Sink
      #
      # Used to export log entries outside Stackdriver Logging. When you create
      # a sink, new log entries are exported. Stackdriver Logging does not send
      # previously-ingested log entries to the sink's destination.
      #
      # A logs filter controls which log entries are exported. Sinks can have a
      # start time and an end time; these can be used to place log entries from
      # an exact time range into a particular destination.  If both `start_at`
      # and `end_at` are present, then `start_at` must be less than `end_at`.
      #
      # Before creating the sink, ensure that you have granted
      # `cloud-logs@google.com` permission to write logs to the destination. See
      # [Permissions for writing exported
      # logs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export#setting_product_name_short_permissions_for_writing_exported_logs).
      #
      # You can retrieve an existing sink with {Project#sink}.
