# google-cloud-error_reporting

[Stackdriver Error Reporting](https://cloud.google.com/error-reporting/) counts,
analyzes and aggregates errors raised in your running cloud services. A
centralized error management interface displays the results with sorting 
and filtering capabilities. A dedicated view shows the error details: time 
chart, occurrences, affected user count, first and last seen dates and a 
cleaned exception stack trace. Opt-in to receive email and mobile alerts on 
new errors.

google-cloud-error_reporting provides an instrumentation API that makes it easy 
to report exceptions to the Stackdriver Error Reporting service. It also 
contains a full API client library for the 
[Stackdriver Error Reporting API](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/clouderrorreporting/v1beta1/) 
(v1beta1).

## Quick Start
```sh
$ gem install google-cloud-error_reporting
```

## Authentication

The Instrumentation client and API use Service Account credentials to connect 
to Google Cloud services. When running on Google Cloud Platform environments, 
the credentials will be discovered automatically. When running on other 
environments the Service Account credentials can be specified by providing the 
path to the JSON file, or the JSON itself, in environment variables or 
configuration code.

Instructions and configuration options are covered in the 
[Authentication Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-error_reporting/guides/authentication).

## Instrumentation Example
```ruby
require "google/cloud/error_reporting"
 
# Configure Stackdriver ErrorReporting instrumentation
Google::Cloud::ErrorReporting.configure do |config|
  config.project_id = "my-project"
  config.keyfile = "/path/to/keyfile.json"
end
 
# Insert a Rack Middleware to report unhanded exceptions 
use Google::Cloud::ErrorReporting::Middleware
 
# Or explicitly submit exceptions
begin
  fail "Boom!"
rescue => exception
  Google::Cloud::ErrorReporting.report exception
end
```

## Rails and Rack Integration

This library also provides a built-in Railtie for Ruby on Rails integration. To
 do this, simply add this line to config/application.rb:
```ruby
require "google/cloud/error_reporting/rails"
```

Alternatively, check out the [stackdriver](../stackdriver) gem, which includes 
this library and enables the Railtie by default.

For Rack integration and more examples, see the
[Instrumentation Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-error_reporting/guides/instrumentation).
