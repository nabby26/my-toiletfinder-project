# stackdriver

This gem instruments a Ruby web application for Stackdriver diagnostics. When loaded, it integrates with Rails, Sinatra, or other Rack-based web frameworks to collect application diagnostic and monitoring information for your application.

Specifically, this gem is a convenience package that loads and automatically activates the instrumentation features of the following gems:
- [google-cloud-debugger](../google-cloud-debugger)
- [google-cloud-error_reporting](../google-cloud-error_reporting)
- [google-cloud-logging](../google-cloud-logging)
- [google-cloud-trace](../google-cloud-trace)

Please see the top-level project [README](../README.md) for more information about the individual Stackdriver google-cloud-ruby gems.

## Quick Start

```sh
$ gem install stackdriver
```

## Overview
Instead of requiring multiple Stackdriver client library gems and explicitly load each built-in Railtie classes, now users can achieve all these through requiring this single **stackdriver** umbrella gem.
```ruby
require "stackdriver"
```
