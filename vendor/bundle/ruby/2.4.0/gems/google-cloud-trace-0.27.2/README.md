# google-cloud-trace

[Stackdriver Trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace/) is a distributed tracing 
system that collects latency data from your applications and displays it in the 
Google Cloud Platform Console. You can track how requests propagate through your
application and receive detailed near real-time performance insights. 
Stackdriver Trace automatically analyzes all of your application's traces to 
generate in-depth latency reports to surface performance degradations, and can 
capture traces from all of your VMs, containers, or Google App Engine projects.

## Quick Start

Install the gem directly:

```sh
$ gem install google-cloud-trace
```

Or install through Bundler:

1. Add the `google-cloud-cloud` gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "google-cloud-cloud"
```

2. Use Bundler to install the gem:

```sh
$ bundle install
```

Alternatively, check out the [`stackdriver`](../stackdriver) gem that includes 
the `google-cloud-cloud` gem.

## Enable Stackdriver Trace API

The Stackdriver Trace library needs the [Stackdriver Trace 
API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudtrace.googleapis.com) 
to be enabled on your Google Cloud project. Make sure it's enabled if not 
already.

## Tracing on Rack-based frameworks

The Stackdriver Trace library for Ruby makes it easy to integrate Stackdriver 
Trace into popular Rack-based Ruby web frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and 
Sinatra. When the library integration is enabled, it automatically traces 
incoming requests in the application.

### With Ruby on Rails

You can load the Railtie that comes with the library into your Ruby 
on Rails application by explicitly requiring it during the application startup:

```ruby
# In config/application.rb
require "google/cloud/trace/rails"
```

If you're using the `stackdriver` gem, it automatically loads the Railtie into 
your application when it starts.

### With other Rack-based frameworks

Other Rack-based frameworks, such as Sinatra, can use the Rack Middleware 
provided by the library:

```ruby
require "google/cloud/trace"
use Google::Cloud::Trace::Middleware
```

### Adding Custom Trace Spans

The Stackdriver Trace Rack Middleware automatically creates a trace record for
incoming requests. You can add additional custom trace spans within each 
request:

```ruby
Google::Cloud::Trace.in_span "my_task" do |span|
  # Do stuff...

  Google::Cloud::Trace.in_span "my_subtask" do |subspan|
    # Do other stuff
  end
end
```

### Configuring the library

You can customize the behavior of the Stackdriver Trace library for Ruby. See 
the [configuration guide](../stackdriver/configuration.md) for a list of 
possible configuration options.

## Running on Google Cloud Platform

The Stackdriver Trace library for Ruby should work without you manually 
providing authentication credentials for instances running on Google Cloud 
Platform, as long as the Stackdriver Trace API access scope is enabled on that 
instance.

### App Engine

On Google App Engine, the Stackdriver Trace API access scope is enabled by 
default, and the Stackdriver Trace library for Ruby can be used without 
providing credentials or a project ID

### Container Engine

On Google Container Engine, you must explicitly add the `trace.append` OAuth 
scope when creating the cluster:

```sh
$ gcloud container clusters create example-cluster-name --scopes https://www.googleapis.com/auth/trace.append
```

### Compute Engine

For Google Compute Engine instances, you need to explicitly enable the 
`trace.append` Stackdriver Trace API access scope for each instance. When 
creating a new instance through the Google Cloud Platform Console, you can do 
this under Identity and API access: Use the Compute Engine default service 
account and select "Allow full access to all Cloud APIs" under Access scopes.

To use something other than the Compute Engine default service account see the 
docs for Creating and Enabling Service Accounts for Instances and the Running 
elsewhere section below. The important thing is that the service account you use
has the Cloud Trace Agent role.

## Running locally and elsewhere

To run the Stackdriver Trace outside of Google Cloud Platform, you must supply 
your GCP project ID and appropriate service account credentials directly to the
Stackdriver Trace. This applies to running the library on your own workstation, 
on your datacenter's computers, or on the VM instances of another cloud 
provider. See the [Authentication section](#authentication) for instructions on 
how to do so.

## Authentication

The Instrumentation client and API use Service Account credentials to connect 
to Google Cloud services. When running on Google Cloud Platform environments, 
the credentials will be discovered automatically. When running on other 
environments the Service Account credentials can be specified by providing in 
several ways.

The best way to provide authentication information if you're using Ruby on Rails
is through the Rails configuration interface:

```ruby
# in config/environments/*.rb
Rails.application.configure do |config|
  # Shared parameters
  config.google_cloud.project_id = "your-project-id"
  config.google_cloud.keyfile = "/path/to/key.json"
  # Or Stackdriver Trace specific parameters
  config.google_cloud.trace.project_id = "your-project-id"
  config.google_cloud.trace.keyfile = "/path/to/key.json"
end
```

Other Rack-based applications that are loading the Rack Middleware directly can use
the configration interface:
 
```ruby
require "google/cloud/trace"
Google::Cloud.configure do |config|
  # Shared parameters
  config.project_id = "your-project-id"
  config.keyfile = "/path/to/key.json"
  # Or Stackdriver Trace specific parameters
  config.trace.project_id = "your-project-id"
  config.trace.keyfile = "/path/to/key.json"
end
```

This library also supports the other authentication methods provided by the 
`google-cloud-ruby` suite. Instructions and configuration options are covered 
in the [Authentication Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-trace/guides/authentication).
