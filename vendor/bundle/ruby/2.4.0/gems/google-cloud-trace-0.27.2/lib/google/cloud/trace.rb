    # # Trace
    #
    # The Stackdriver Trace service collects and stores latency data from your
    # application and displays it in the Google Cloud Platform Console, giving
    # you detailed near-real-time insight into application performance.
    #
    # The Stackdriver Trace Ruby library, `google-cloud-trace`, provides:
    #
    # *   Easy-to-use trace instrumentation that collects and collates latency
    #     data for your Ruby application. If you just want latency trace data
    #     for your application to appear on the Google Cloud Platform Console,
    #     see the section on [instrumenting your app](#instrumenting-your-app).
    # *   An idiomatic Ruby API for querying, analyzing, and manipulating trace
    #     data in your Ruby application. For an introduction to the Trace API,
    #     see the section on the [Trace API](#stackdriver-trace-api).
    #
    # ## Instrumenting Your App
    #
    # This library integrates with Rack-based web frameworks such as Ruby On
    # Rails to provide latency trace reports for your application.
    # Specifcally, it:
    #
    # *   Provides a Rack middleware that automatically reports latency traces
    #     for http requests handled by your application, and measures the
    #     latency of each request as a whole.
    # *   Integrates with `ActiveSupport::Notifications` to add important
    #     latency-affecting events such as ActiveRecord queries to the trace.
    # *   Provides a simple API for your application code to define and
    #     measure latency-affecting processes specific to your application.
    #
    # When this library is installed and configured in your running
    # application, you can view your application's latency traces in real time
    # by opening the Google Cloud Console in your web browser and navigating
    # to the "Trace" section. It also integrates with Google App Engine
    # Flexible and Google Container Engine to provide additional information
    # for applications hosted in those environments.
    #
    # Note that not all requests will have traces. By default, the library will
    # sample about one trace every ten seconds per Ruby process, to prevent
    # heavily used applications from reporting too much data. It will also
    # omit certain requests used by Google App Engine for health checking. See
    # {Google::Cloud::Trace::TimeSampler} for more details.
    #
    # ### Using instrumentation with Ruby on Rails
    #
    # To install application instrumentation in your Ruby on Rails app, add
    # this gem, `google-cloud-trace`, to your Gemfile and update your bundle.
    # Then add the following line to your `config/application.rb` file:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/trace/rails"
    # ```
    #
    # This will install a Railtie that automatically integrates with the
    # Rails framework, installing the middleware and the ActiveSupport
    # integration for you. Your application traces, including basic request
    # tracing, ActiveRecord query measurements, and view render measurements,
    # should then start appearing in the Cloud Console.
    #
    # See the {Google::Cloud::Trace::Railtie} class for more information,
    # including how to customize your application traces.
    #
    # ### Using instrumentation with Sinatra
    #
    # To install application instrumentation in your Sinatra app, add this gem,
    # `google-cloud-trace`, to your Gemfile and update your bundle. Then add
    # the following lines to your main application Ruby file:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/trace"
    # use Google::Cloud::Trace::Middleware
    # ```
    #
    # This will install the trace middleware in your application, providing
    # basic request tracing for your application. You may measure additional
    # processes such as database queries or calls to external services using
    # other classes in this library. See the {Google::Cloud::Trace::Middleware}
    # documentation for more information.
    #
    # ### Using instrumentation with other Rack-based frameworks
    #
    # To install application instrumentation in an app using another Rack-based
    # web framework, add this gem, `google-cloud-trace`, to your Gemfile and
    # update your bundle. Then add install the trace middleware in your
    # middleware stack. In most cases, this means adding these lines to your
    # `config.ru` Rack configuration file:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/trace"
    # use Google::Cloud::Trace::Middleware
    # ```
    #
    # Some web frameworks have an alternate mechanism for modifying the
    # middleware stack. Consult your web framework's documentation for more
    # information.
    #
    # ### The Stackdriver diagnostics suite
    #
    # The trace library is part of the Stackdriver diagnostics suite, which
    # also includes error reporting and log analysis. If you include the
    # `stackdriver` gem in your Gemfile, this trace library will be included
    # automatically. In addition, if you include the `stackdriver` gem in an
    # application using Ruby On Rails, the Railtie will be installed
    # automatically; you will not need to write any code to view latency
    # traces for your appl. See the documentation for the "stackdriver" gem
    # for more details.
    #
    # ## Stackdriver Trace API
    #
    # This library also includes an easy to use Ruby client for the
    # Stackdriver Trace API. This API provides calls to report and modify
    # application traces, as well as to query and analyze existing traces.
    #
    # For further information on the trace API, see
    # {Google::Cloud::Trace::Project}.
    #
    # ### Querying traces using the API
    #
    # Using the Stackdriver Trace API, your application can query and analyze
    # its own traces and traces of other projects. Here is an example query
    # for all traces in the past hour.
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/trace"
    # trace_client = Google::Cloud::Trace.new
    #
    # traces = trace_client.list_traces Time.now - 3600, Time.now
    # traces.each do |trace|
    #   puts "Retrieved trace ID: #{trace.trace_id}"
    # end
    # ```
    #
    # Each trace is an object of type {Google::Cloud::Trace::TraceRecord},
    # which provides methods for analyzing tasks that took place during the
    # request trace. See https://cloud.google.com/trace for more information
    # on the kind of data you can capture in a trace.
    #
    # ### Reporting traces using the API
    #
    # Usually it is easiest to use this library's trace instrumentation
    # features to collect and record application trace information. However,
    # you may also use the trace API to update this data. Here is an example:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/trace"
    #
    # trace_client = Google::Cloud::Trace.new
    #
    # trace = Google::Cloud::Trace.new
    # trace.in_span "root_span" do
    #   # Do stuff...
    # end
    #
    # trace_client.patch_traces trace
    # ```
    #
    module Trace
      THREAD_KEY = :__stackdriver_trace_span__

      # Initialize :error_reporting as a nested Configuration under
      # Google::Cloud if haven't already
      unless Google::Cloud.configure.option? :trace
        Google::Cloud.configure.add_options :trace
      end
